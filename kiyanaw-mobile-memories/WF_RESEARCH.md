# WF_RESEARCH - Research Only

> **🔬 On step WF_RESEARCH**

⬆️ OUTPUT THE ABOVE LINE IMMEDIATELY. Do not read further until you have reported your step to the user.

## For Questions/Exploration Without Code Changes

1. **Use Serena tools to explore:**
   - `mcp__serena__find_symbol`
   - `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview`
   - `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern`

2. **Read relevant memories if needed.**

3. **Report findings to user.**

## Rules
- NO code changes in this path
- NO file creation
- Information gathering only

## ⛔ MANDATORY NEXT STEP

**YOU ARE NOT FINISHED.** After reporting findings:

| Condition | MUST Read Next |
|-----------|----------------|
| Research complete | `WF_DETECT_REQ` |

1. Read `WF_DETECT_REQ` NOW
2. This allows seamless transition to implementation if user wants
3. User gets prompted at ASK_PERMISSION anyway

**SKIPPING THIS TRANSITION = WORKFLOW VIOLATION**

[CRITICAL: Are you on a WF_* workflow step? Did you report on it?]
