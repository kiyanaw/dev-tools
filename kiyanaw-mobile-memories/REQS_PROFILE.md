# REQS_PROFILE - Profile Feature Requirements

## Navigation

- [ ] Profile is a tab screen (like Home, Browse, My Questions - not a stack screen)
- [ ] Uses tab header styling (consistent with other tabs)
- [ ] Content is scrollable (anticipate more options)

## Dialect Selection

- [ ] User can select multiple dialects for search
- [ ] One dialect is marked as "default"
- [ ] Default dialect used when filtering isn't explicitly chosen
- [ ] Checkboxes for dialect selection (not single picker)

## Display

- [ ] Avatar with user initial
- [ ] Display name (editable)
- [ ] Selected dialects visible
- [ ] Language names must be dynamic (derived from config, never hardcoded)

## Future Considerations

- Additional profile options will be added (scrollable requirement)
- Settings may include notification preferences, etc.
