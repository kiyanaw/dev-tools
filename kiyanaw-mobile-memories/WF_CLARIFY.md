# WF_CLARIFY - Ask User

> **💬 On step WF_CLARIFY**

⬆️ OUTPUT THE ABOVE LINE IMMEDIATELY. Do not read further until you have reported your step to the user.

---

## When To Use

- Request is unclear
- Requirement conflicts with documented behavior
- User declined proposed changes
- Need to choose between approaches

## Ask User

Format your question clearly:
- "You said X, but FEATURE_[Y] says Z. Which is correct?"
- "I'm not sure what you want. Do you mean A or B?"
- "You declined. What should I do differently?"

## ⛔ MANDATORY NEXT STEP

**YOU ARE NOT FINISHED.** After user responds:

| Return To | MUST Read Next |
|-----------|----------------|
| From CLASSIFY | `WF_CLASSIFY` |
| From REQUIREMENT | `WF_REQUIREMENT` |
| From ASK_PERMISSION | `WF_ASK_PERMISSION` |
| From PLAN_ARCHITECTURE | `WF_PLAN_ARCHITECTURE` |

1. Note where you came from
2. After user responds, read that WF_* memory
3. Report the new step to user

**SKIPPING THIS TRANSITION = WORKFLOW VIOLATION**

[CRITICAL: Are you on a WF_* workflow step? Did you report on it?]
