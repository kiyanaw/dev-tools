# TP_UI - UI Screen Template

## Structure

```markdown
# UI_[SCREEN] - [Screen Name]

## Purpose
[What this screen does for users - 1-2 sentences]

## Route
`/path/to/screen`

## Features Used
- FEATURE_X - [what aspect is used]
- FEATURE_Y - [what aspect is used]

## Layout
[Brief description - what sections/areas exist]

## Behavior Notes
[Any UX specifics: gestures, navigation, states]
```

## Rules

- NO symbol/component lists - those belong in FEATURE_* memories
- Reference features, don't duplicate their content
- Keep brief - this is navigation aid, not specification
- Create UI_* only for screens with multiple features or complex behavior
